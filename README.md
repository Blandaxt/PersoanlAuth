# My awesome Dolphin site:

1. The user can go to my site to create an account.

2. The user can watch a video once in their account.

3. The user can leave a comment in their account.

4. The user can upload files in their account.

5. After logging out, the user can log back into their account.

##How it's made:

*Tech Used:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and Passport.js

I made this site by first taking my last project OAuth as a [basis](https://github.com/Blandaxt/express-auth). Then changed the pictures and added my topic which is dolphins. Then i added image tags to my sign up page and other ejs page. Then i added a video tag to my profile page. Then i edited all my ejs files to include the topic which is dolphins. Finally i edited my .gitignore file so i do not upload any node modules and other json packages. 

## Optimization:

If i had more time, i would include better CSS styling to my template engine files. I would also include a date and time for each comment posted. i would so add and icon for each user so that they can have a bit more identification when posting a comment.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`
