# My awesome Dolphin site:

1. The user can go to my site to create an account.

2. The user can watch a video once in their account.

3. The user can leave a comment in their account.

4. The user can upload files in their account.

5. After logging out, the user can log back into their account.

## Optimization:

If i had more time, i would include better CSS styling to my template engine files. I would also include a date and time for each comment posted. i would so add and icon for each user so that they can have a bit more identification when posting a comment. 

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8080`
